<h1>Hamburger Icon Animation</h1>

<p>Animate transition between closed and open flyout menu states from 2 bar hamburger menu icon to "x".</p>

<hr />

<h4>Considerations</h4>

<p>Traditional standard 3 bar burger icon should be reduced to 2 bars to support the animation more seamlessly. Still determining if UX would support the change as users may not identify the 2 bar burger as a menu icon.</p>
